                                                This Will Template is used to make a Will for only liquid (cash) assets,
                                                such as bank accounts, investments, insurance policies (including Group
                                                Life Insurance put in place by employers), gratuity, Retirement Saving

                                                This Will Template cannot cover landed assets but is designed to aid
                                                persons who own only liquid assets in protecting same. Therefore, if you
                                                have landed assets to protect, you should opt for the Simple Will

                                            </p>
                                            However, it is imperative to know that this Will just like all Wills
                                            only comes into effect after the demise of the Testator (Maker).

                                                Islamic Law allows a Muslim Testator to only make a Will that freely
                                                distributes up to 1/3rd of his/her entire estate, a Muslim Will cannot
                                                be used to reduce, alter or exclude legal heirs (blood relatives) whose
                                                share in the Testator’s Estate are already apportioned in the Quran or
                                                Sunnah. Succinctly explained, while the Testator of a Muslim Will can
                                                voluntary distribute up to 1/3rd of his entire Estate as he desires, the
                                                remaining 2/3rd must be left for his legal heirs and distributed in
                                                accordance with the distribution system laid down in Islam.
